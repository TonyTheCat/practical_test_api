This is practical test API

To run it, please do as follows:
1. Be sure to use `Node js v14.19.0` as it was built and tested with this version.
2. Install npm modules with `npm install` command.
3. Create your free `MondoDB` cluster https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/ (recommended) or set up your local `MongoDB` server.
4. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and populate env vars with desired values. Set `port` for your API and DB connecting string, substituting with actual values instead of `<variable>`.
5. Run API with `npm start` command.
